# ActionConditionalChecker.Contracts

Implements contracts for both synchronous and asynchronous condition checkers in order to find out if the action may be executed under specific circumstances.
The corresponding conditions/rules are persisted into a blocking collection and are available till the persisted request/action has been terminated.
